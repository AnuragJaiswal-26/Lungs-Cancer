# Lungs-Cancer
Predicting the risk of lungs cancer using machine learning model.

As we all know we live in an environment where people are opened to various factors which can lead to serious diseases in their life. In such a situation, the risk of disease like lung cancer is becoming more and more common. 
Understanding this situation and problem, we have created a machine learning model in which people doesn't need to have any medical report, they just need to rate several living factors on a scale of 10(except age and gender), and the model will predict in how much risk you are of having this disease.
For now, this much work has been done on this project, we are still working to make it more efficient such as how to take precautions if you are in a danger risk of having lungs cancer.
Thank You.
